1.  Introduction

   The PSP Security Protocol (PSP) is designed to enable scaling to
   large numbers of SAs without requiring per-SA hardware state in the
   NIC.  The PSP v2 extends these concepts using Encapsulating Security
   Payload (EESP),[I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp], packet format and
   features supported in EESP.

2.  Stateless Decryption

   Stateless Decriptions is very friendly for hardware offloads it is
   more aligned with bump-in-the-wire than per session keys negotiated
   in IKEv2, [RFC7296]

2.1.  Advantages

   *  High throughput packets per second

   *  lack of central SADB, SPDB scales well

   *  Hardware offload friendly

   *  Data center friendly

   *  High rate of connection establishing and tear down 200K/sec

2.2.  Derive longer keys

   Instead of deriving a 128bit key, derive a longer key and use the
   next 32bits as the salt for tge IV.  The reciver when it generate the
   key and send to the sender should send a longer key,

2.3.  AEX XTR KDF/PRF

   AES XTR also could be used as KDF function?  Which is likely faster
   than AES-CMAC?
